FMBomb
======

Description
-----------

A very simple hardware project to broadcast your voice or other sound 
input on an FM station of your choosing. Uses the PIC 16F688 as the 
main microcontroller. A Codeproject article located at 
[http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/fmbomb.aspx](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/fmbomb.aspx) talks about the 
creation of the project.

Technical Points
----------------

The FMBomb can be powered with 3 to 5 volts. A 30 inch piece of 
wire attached to the transmitter RF pin makes a decent antenna 
with pretty good range.
